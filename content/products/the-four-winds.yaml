  The latest book by Kristin Hannah, author of The Nightingale and The Great Alone.

  The setting of the story is in America during the time of Great Depression.

  One reviewer described it as a "riveting story of love, courage, and sacrifice".

  Newsweek called it "Brutally beautiful."

  Real Simple summarized it as "... a sweeping epic about an American struggling to keep her family afloat. ...highlights the ways women rally during a national crisis."
